# Global-CO-Emissions-Dashboard-Power-BI
A comprehensive analysis of global CO₂ emissions from 2010–2023 using publicly available data. This project demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, DAX modeling, and interactive Power BI visualization to uncover major environmental insights.

Project Overview -
This project analyzes global CO₂ and GHG emissions using a country-wise dataset containing yearly emission metrics, economic indicators, and energy usage.
The dashboard explains:
• Global trends in CO₂ emissions
• Top emitting countries and regional behaviour
• Factors influencing emissions
• Per-country deep-dive
• Insights derived from time-series & influencer visuals

Dataset
Source: Our World In Data (OWID) – CO₂ & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Dataset

Final cleaned dataset includes:
•	Country, Year, ISO code
•	Population
•	GDP
•	CO₂ Emission
•	CO₂ Per Capita
•	Coal, Oil, Gas, Cement CO₂
•	Total GHG
•	Methane & Nitrous Oxide
•	Energy indicators (Energy per capita, Energy Intensity, Energy per GDP)
•	Other Calculated columns for analysis (Total Fossil & Fossil Share)

All data for non-country aggregates (World/Continents/Income Groups) were removed.
